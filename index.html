                <p>
                    Thank you for giving this wonderful opportunity to me to introduce myself to you. I am Sushant sharma. We are four members in my family including me.  
                    I am native to Gurgaon, and open to relocate to Gurgaon. 
                    Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech in Cse at the DCE, and I will be entering into 2nd  year of my graduation studies. 
                    Ever since, I started studying cse in my school days. I realized,
                     I enjoy analyzing things connected to the society, and the Mother Nature. Since my childhood days, 
                     I have witnessed my family focusing upon correct utilization of house hold items, 
                     and guiding us towards understanding the whites, and blacks of the possible outcomes. 
                     I believe, this somehow further boosted my interest towards CS as a career option.
